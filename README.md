# Outcomes for Recent Kickstarter Campaigns for Plays
## Overview of Project
The fundraising for the upcoming play _Fever_ has finished and the goal was nearly reached.  Kickstarter funding camapaigns started from October 2010 to May 2017 were reviewed to determine when past campaigns tended to be more successful and if the goal amount for fundraising impacted the outcome of the campaign.  This analysis was undertaken to help predict whether the fundraising efforts for _Fever_ will result in a successful launch.  Although the data set encompassed a relatively large amount of plays during this time frame (over 1,000), past outcomes may not be consistent with future results.  Further, campaigns created in Great Britian only represented 30% of the data set; therefore, evaluating plays from all over the world may not be reprensentative of fundraising success in this country.
