# Outcomes for Recent Kickstarter Campaigns for Plays
## Overview of Project
The fundraising for the upcoming play _Fever_ has finished and the goal was nearly reached.  Kickstarter funding camapaigns started from October 2010 to May 2017 were reviewed to determine when past campaigns tended to be more successful and if the goal amount for fundraising impacted the outcome of the campaign.  This analysis was undertaken to help predict whether the fundraising efforts for _Fever_ will result in a successful launch.  The full analysis can be found here:  [Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx](https://github.com/clevkelz/kickstarter-analysis/files/8882965/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis
The analysis consisted of two portions:
1. A comparison of the timing of new Kickstarter campaigns by month to the outcomes of the campaign, specifically if the campaign succeeded, failed, or was canceled.
2. A comparison of the size of the fundraising goal to the outcomes of the campaign.
#### Timing of Campaign by the Month Launched to the Eventual Outcome of the Campaign

The outcome of each theater campaign launched my month was identified with an outcome of succeeded, failed, or canceled.  Theater campaigns were most frequently launched in May or June.  Of the 1,369 theater campaigns created during this time frame, 12% were in May and 11% were in June.  Campaigns during these months may be more successful because there are often more venues to put on plays, specifically open-air settings that are only avaialble in warmer weather.  The fewest number of campaigns were lauched in December with only 5% of campaigns created in this month. The creators of campaigns may feel that the public has less of an appetite to donate to theater campaigns during the height of the holiday season when donators are likely to focus on providing funds to charitable organizations.  Challenges with new campaigns at year-end are also exacerbated by a high failure rate.  Almost half of all compaigns luanched in December did not succeed.
#### Size of Goal to Eventual Outcome of the Campaign

The size of the Kickstarter goal for plays was divided into 11 categories as shown in the above graph and compared to outcomes of these campaigns.  None of these campaigns was canceled during this time frame so the two outcomes were success or failure.  Generally, a lower goal amount indicated a higher chance of success; however, campaigns with a goal amount between 35,000 and 45,000 denominated in local currencies were more successful than campaigns with slightly smaller goals (between 25,000 and 35,000) and those with higher goals (more than 50,000).

### Challenges
Although the data set encompassed a relatively large amount of plays and theater campaigns (over 1,000 and nearly 1,400 respectively) during this time frame), past outcomes may not be consistent with future results.  Further, campaigns created in Great Britian only represented 30% of the data set; therefore, evaluating plays from all over the world may not be reprensentative of fundraising success in this country.  
##Results
Three general conclusions were reached from reviewing the data:
1. The launching of theater campaigns tends to be cyclical, with the largest amount of campaigns begun from May to August of each year.  New launches fall sharply at the end of the year.
2. The highest failure rates for new theater campaigns are for those launched at the end of the year.  The failure rate for Kickstarter campaigns in October is 43% and 47% in December.
3. Smaller goals for play fundraisers generally result in more successful outcomes.

Although this data provides useful information regarding outcomes of recent fundraising efforts for theaterical performances, including plays, it would be beneficial to explore other information related to fundraising efforts, including direct donations and other funds not obtained through Kickstarter.  Limiting the analysis to Kickstarter data may not provide an accurate picture of how theaters obtain funding and the success of their fundraising campaigns.  Further, an analysis of Kickstarter data by year would be helful to determine whether the platform has become more popular and, thus, is a reliable source for obtaining donations.
